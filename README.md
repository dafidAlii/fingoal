 Theme: Economics Empowerment: Navigating Sustainable Economies for All

<h2>Our Project</h2>
<p>The digital era has reshaped economic habits worldwide, with purchasing and transaction behaviors increasingly integrated into digital systems. While this shift offers convenience, it has also driven a rise in consumerism fueled by targeted ads and easy online access, often leading individuals to overlook essential household budget priorities. Many find themselves struggling to manage finances effectively, impacting their ability to achieve financial goals like building emergency funds or making significant purchases.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, we are developing an Android-based application designed to help users manage their finances efficiently. The application offers features for allocating funds and setting financial targets, allowing users to strategically save for their financial goals. Leveraging machine learning, our app provides personalized recommendations on savings allocation, target amounts, and timelines tailored to the user’s income, expenses, and financial objectives.</p>
